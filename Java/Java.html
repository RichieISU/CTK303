<p class="style">"Elden Ring" is an action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment. The game is a collaboration between Hidetaka Miyazaki, the creator of the "Dark Souls" series, and George R. R. Martin, the author of "A Song of Ice and Fire" series, which inspired the television series "Game of Thrones." Set in a dark fantasy world called the Lands Between, "Elden Ring" features a vast and interconnected open-world environment. The central plot revolves around the shattering of the Elden Ring, a powerful artifact that has maintained the balance of the world. The fragments of the Elden Ring have given rise to the demigods, each possessing unique powers.

The game emphasizes exploration, challenging combat, and a deep lore-rich narrative. Players can traverse diverse landscapes, encounter formidable enemies, and engage in intense battles against both powerful bosses and hostile creatures. The fractured world of the Lands Between is filled with mysteries, hidden secrets, and interconnected stories waiting to be uncovered. As players progress, they can customize their character, choosing from various classes, abilities, and weapons. The combination of FromSoftware's signature challenging gameplay and George R. R. Martin's storytelling promises a unique and immersive experience for fans of both creators. "Elden Ring" has generated significant anticipation due to its pedigree and the promise of a rich, atmospheric world filled with engaging gameplay and a compelling narrative.Elden Ring" also introduces a dynamic day-night cycle and weather system, adding an extra layer of complexity to the game world.

    <h2>Different Projects From FromSoftware</h2> 
    <img class="From" src="FromSoftware.jpg" alt="gamestudio">
    <p class="style">FromSoftware is a renowned Japanese video game development studio known for its distinctive approach to game design and challenging gameplay mechanics. As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, here are some notable projects developed by FromSoftware:

        Demon's Souls (2009): Often credited with popularizing the "Soulsborne" genre, "Demon's Souls" was a groundbreaking action RPG known for its punishing difficulty, atmospheric world design, and innovative online multiplayer features. The success of this title laid the foundation for FromSoftware's subsequent projects.
        
        Dark Souls series (2011-2016): The "Dark Souls" series expanded upon the concepts introduced in "Demon's Souls." These games are renowned for their interconnected world design, deep lore, and challenging combat. "Dark Souls II" and "Dark Souls III" continued to build upon the series' reputation for demanding gameplay and intricate level design.
        
        Bloodborne (2015): An action RPG with a Gothic horror theme, "Bloodborne" departed from the traditional fantasy setting of the Souls series. It featured faster-paced combat, a unique weapon transformation system, and a hauntingly atmospheric world. "Bloodborne" received critical acclaim for its art style, gameplay, and narrative.
        
        Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice (2019): "Sekiro" marked a departure from the RPG mechanics of the Soulsborne series, emphasizing stealth, precision combat, and a rich narrative. The game won several Game of the Year awards for its exceptional level design, challenging encounters, and the inclusion of a protagonist with a predefined character.
        
        Armored Core series (1997-2013): Before gaining widespread recognition with the Soulsborne games, FromSoftware was known for the "Armored Core" series. These were mech-based action games that allowed players to customize their mechs for intense battles. The series spanned multiple entries and contributed significantly to FromSoftware's early success.</p>

    <h2>More About Elden Ring</h2> 
    <p class="text">The world of Elden Ring is one filled with magic, miracles, and demi-gods. The game is set in a place called the Lands Between, where demi-gods rule over different regions in the wake of wars and events that led to the shattering of the titular Elden Ring. The Elden Ring is a conduit of sorts that is at the centre of the power of the Erdtree, which blesses the Lands Between with immortality, as a result. 

        The world is kept in balance, primarily, by Queen Marika, one of the most powerful immortals, who went on to have a few children, who are classed as demi-gods. Her second husband was a man called Radagon, who was initially with Rennala. There are also some hints in the game that Marika and Radagon are literally halves of the same person, but it’s hard to know for certain. 
        
        Because of this legacy of immortals and gods, death is highly unusual, let alone the death of one of the great lords. Despite that, the world was turned on its head when a group discovers the key to ending immortality and descends upon the Lands Between to kill Godwyn the Golden, and the body of Ranni the Witch, but not her soul. After this event, the Elden Ring was shattered, seemingly by Radagon, and the world was thrown into chaos. 
        
        This is because of multiple things. For starters, some people became unable to see the guiding grace of the Erdtree because of its weakened power. These beings are known as Tarnished (which is you) and are all seemingly linked to the first Elden Lord Godfrey, in some way. This also led to the other demi-gods ending up locked in an endless battle with one another, unable to overcome each other, thus throwing the Lands Between into war, and also leading to it being effectively segmented too. </p>
